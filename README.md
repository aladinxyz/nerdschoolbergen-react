## Focus of this workshop
We will learn about React and build React components using the well-known Todo application as our use-case. After making a few components and making them render to the screen, we'll install Redux. We'll then move our state over to be handled by Redux and inject it back into React.

Time estimate: 4-6 hours

## What you need
-	Google Chrome
  - Extension: "React dev tools"
  - Extension: "Redux dev tools"
-	An text editor that understands JavaScript and React (Atom, Visual Studio Code, SublimeText, etc). If you're using Atom, you'll need to install the plugin `react` as well.
-	NodeJS (latest) og npm (latest). Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check what version you have. Check the latest version at [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and upgrade if you're out of date.
